## What is scala? 
>Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

## Why scala?
1. Compatible - with java code. Scala programs compile to JVM bytecodes. The run time is almost the same as java. 
2. concise - Scala code is very small compared to java code. A lot of the boilerplate code from java is optional.  
3. High-level - it lets manage complexity by letting you raise the level of abstraction.
