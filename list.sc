val oneTwo = List(1,2)
val threeFour = List(3,4)

val allTogether = oneTwo ::: threeFour

//Since we cant mutate with list this is going to create a new list and this is a way to join / concat ':::'

//Our output should be a new list with the values 1,2,3,4

//Overall means oneTwo and ThreeFour are still the same.
